## Important
This is a work-in-progress.

If you want to help, please create a new issue when you find areas that you think look off compared to the rest of the app. In that issue also add how you got to the unthemed part since it might be something I don't use and therefor missed. 

### Colors
When you see any extreme colors such as #ff0000, #00ff00, #0000ff, that means you have found a none-themed area. Please create an issue and report it.

## Installing
Updated with new steps once the extension is released

## Feedback
If you have any feedback for my theme, please create an issue with your suggestion.
