# Relaxed Dark - Theme for Visual Studio Code
**A relaxing dark theme for to make your daily coding pleasant for your eyes**

## Important
This is a work-in-progress. If you want to use this theme you are free too. However, there are parts of the app that still isn't themed.

If you want to help, please create a new issue when you find areas that you think look off compared to the rest of the app. In that issue also add how you got to the unthemed part since it might be something I don't use and therefor missed. 

### Colors
When you see any of these colors in the app, that is something that I haven't done yet.

1. #008000 - App
2. #0000FF - Text
3. #F26419 - Text
4. #7D1D3F - Text
5. #3C95B9 - Text

## Installing
I haven't released this on the Microsoft Marketplace for Visual Studio Code extensions yet. I will do this in the future, but for now if you want to install it you need to: 
1. download the the repo 
2. Place the folder in `<user home>/.vscode/extensions` folder
3. Restart.
4. Open `File > Preferences > Color Themes` and pick **"Relaxed Dark"**

## Feedback
If you have any feedback for my theme, please create an issue with your suggestion.
