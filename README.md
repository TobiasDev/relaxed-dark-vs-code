# Relaxed Dark - Theme for Visual Studio Code
**A relaxing dark theme to make your daily coding pleasant for your eyes**

This theme is part of a bigger package of themes that I want to create for all my daily drivers. You can find the main repo here: https://github.com/TobiasDev/relaxed-dark

## Important
This is a work-in-progress.

If you want to help, please create a new issue when you find areas that you think look off compared to the rest of the app. In that issue also add how you got to the unthemed part since it might be something I don't use and therefor missed. 

### Colors
When you see any extreme colors such as #ff0000, #00ff00, #0000ff, that means you have found a none-themed area. Please create an issue and report it.

## Installing
You can search for "Relaxed Dark" in the ExtensionBar and you should be able to find it. If not, feel free to download it directly from the extension page: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TobiasDev.relaxed-dark

## Feedback
If you have any feedback for my theme, please create an issue with your suggestion.
