## Important
This is a work-in-progress. If you want to use this theme you are free too. However, there are parts of the app that still isn't themed.

If you want to help, please create a new issue when you find areas that you think look off compared to the rest of the app. In that issue also add how you got to the unthemed part since it might be something I don't use and therefor missed. 

### Colors
When you see any of these colors in the app, that is something that I haven't done yet.

1. #008000 - App
2. #0000FF - Text
3. #F26419 - Text
4. #7D1D3F - Text
5. #3C95B9 - Text

## Installing
Updated with new steps once the extension is released

## Feedback
If you have any feedback for my theme, please create an issue with your suggestion. 

# TODO
_Here are the list of things that isn't done / planned to be fixed for the theme_   

- [ ] The text colors used for code will need to be tweaked as I use this for my daily coding and notice issues or improvements
- [ ] Terminal text colors are still using the default VS Code colors
- [ ] There are sections of the app that isn't themed yet
- [ ] I need to update / add some new colors since I'm running into issues themeing other apps with the "Relaxed Dark" colors. See [Relaxed Dark Color Palette](https://github.com/TobiasDev/relaxed-dark-vs-code/blob/main/relaxed-dark-color-palette.md)

# General "Relaxed Dark" Theme planning
Once I'm happy with my VS Code theme, I would like to implement this in more of my daily apps. There is no time-frame on this, and it could be that this never happens. However, if I keep going with this theme, these are the other apps I would like to implement a version of this theme in.   

- [ ] KDE Plasma Global Theme (Decorations, Colors, Login-screen, etc.)
- [ ] [Joplin](https://github.com/laurent22/joplin) - Note-taking application
- [ ] [rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi) or [uLauncher](https://github.com/Ulauncher/Ulauncher) - Keyboard launcher for Linux
- [ ] [UELI](https://github.com/oliverschwendener/ueli) - Keyboard launcher for Windows 10
- [ ] Terminal: Konsole (default terminal for KDE)
- [ ] Terminal: For Windows I don't have a good default terminal yet, but I want to find one with theming and that will then get this theme
